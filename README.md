Minimal text editor written as an excuse to get my head around C again

Based on the kilo editor from:
http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/

Loosely based on how I use vim.

In a state that it can alter files, and save them

Things that are working:
* Modes: Insert, and Normal
* Searching

TODO:
* Yank / Delete and paste with the stack (y/d/p/P)
* Fix some of the segfaults since breaking up the files
* Simple syntax highlighting, based off the latter parts of the kilo tutorial
