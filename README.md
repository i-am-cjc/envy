# envy

Minimal text editor written as an excuse to get my head around C again
Based on the kilo editor from:
http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/

Loosely based on how I use vim.

In a state that it can alter files, and save them

Things that are working:
* Modes: Insert, and Normal
* Searching
